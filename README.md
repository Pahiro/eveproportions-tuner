# EveProportions — In-Game Tuner (contribution)

Adds an in-game adjustment panel to EveProportions: press **F7** and the
`WBP_EveProportions` widget that already ships in the mod's pak (currently
dormant — pure layout, no blueprint logic) appears with 8 working sliders.
Values apply live to the post-process AnimBP, persist across sessions, and
re-apply automatically on outfit changes. **No pak changes are needed** —
everything runs through UE4SS Lua against the existing assets.

While the panel is open:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Left/Right arrows | fine-tune the last-touched slider (step configurable) |
| 1–9 / Shift+1–9 | load / save preset slot (`TunerPresets.lua`) |
| 0 / Shift+0 | bind / unbind current values to the worn outfit (`TunerOutfits.lua`) |

Outfit bindings are keyed by the body mesh asset path (works for CNS custom
outfits too): a bound outfit adopts its own values whenever it's equipped,
and switching to an unbound outfit restores the saved defaults. A shortcut
legend is appended to the panel at runtime (a `TextBlock` constructed via
`StaticConstructObject` and added to the widget's VBox — again, no pak edit).

Slider labels are renamed at runtime to match their observed in-game effect
(the `DISPLAY` map), and `B_Bip001_Pelvis` was dropped from the Hip group:
scaling it scales the entire skeleton from the pelvis origin (a duplicate of
Size that sinks the feet into the ground). Without it, the group's `Hip_Reg`
bones turn out to be a clean butt-size control.

## Files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `EveProportionsTuner.lua` | New script — all tuner logic, self-contained module. |
| `main.lua.patch` | 5-line diff against the original `main.lua` (3 integration points, see below). |
| `main.lua` | Full patched copy, if you prefer that over applying the patch. |
| `EveProportionsConfig.lua` | Config with two new keys: `EnableTuner` (default `true`) and `TunerKey` (default `"F7"`). |
| `UE4SS_Signatures/FText_Constructor.lua` | AOB signature for the FText constructor — copy to `ue4ss/UE4SS_Signatures/`. See below. |

`Scripts/TunerValues.lua`, `Scripts/TunerPresets.lua`, and
`Scripts/TunerOutfits.lua` are created at runtime next to the scripts to
store the user's values, presets, and outfit bindings (all safe to delete;
they regenerate with defaults).

## If pressing F7 crashes the game (FText signature)

UE4SS finds the native `FText` constructor by AOB scan, and on Stellar Blade
the stock UE4SS 3.0.1 scan **fails** — `UE4SS.log` shows:

```
[PS] Failed to find FText::FText(FString&&): expected at least one value
[PS] You can supply your own AOB in 'UE4SS_Signatures/FText_Constructor.lua'
```

Without it, constructing an `FText` from Lua (the tuner does this for slider
labels) can crash the game the moment the panel opens. Fix: copy
`UE4SS_Signatures/FText_Constructor.lua` from this repo into
`SB/Binaries/Win64/ue4ss/UE4SS_Signatures/` (create the folder if needed).
When it works, `UE4SS.log` shows `FText::FText address: ... <- Lua Script`
instead of the failure.

As of v1.1.1 the tuner also routes text through a helper that falls back to
`KismetTextLibrary::Conv_StringToText` (a plain UFunction call, no scan
needed) when `FText()` fails cleanly — but the signature file is the reliable
fix, so install it either way.

## Integration points in main.lua

1. Top of file: `local Tuner = nil; pcall(function() Tuner = require("EveProportionsTuner") end)` —
   pcall-guarded, so main.lua behaves exactly as before if the tuner file is
   removed or `EnableTuner = false`.
2. In `refreshAnimation`, the "already active" early-return: `Tuner.ApplyTo(active)`.
3. In `refreshAnimation`, after `SetAnimationMode` recreates the instance: `Tuner.ApplyTo(after)`.

These two `ApplyTo` calls re-stamp the saved slider values onto fresh
post-process instances at your existing refresh boundaries. A
`NotifyOnNewObject` on the ABP class catches instances created outside those
paths (e.g. level load). Deliberately **not** a polling loop — a 1 s
`FindAllOf` watcher caused a visible once-per-second hitch in cinematics.

## How the sliders drive the ABP (implementation notes)

- Each slider is a **size multiplier**: 1.0 = your authored shape, below 1.0
  moves toward vanilla, above exaggerates. Since the authored bone scales
  shrink (0.7–0.9), this is implemented as `Scale' = authored * value`
  (Translation/Rotation likewise), writing directly into the
  `FAnimNode_ModifyBone` struct properties. The `B_<bone>` alpha floats can't
  be used for exaggeration — anim blend weights clamp at 1.0.
- The node struct properties are discovered at runtime by iterating class
  properties and reading `BoneToModify.BoneName`, so the script survives you
  adding/renaming nodes without a mapping update. Baselines are read from the
  **CDO**, not the instance (instances are polluted after Lua hot-reload).
- Slider→bone grouping lives in the `GROUPS` table at the top of the tuner
  script — trivially editable if you'd group them differently.

## UE4SS gotchas baked into the script (the hard-won stuff)

- Keybind callbacks are **not** on the game thread — everything hops via
  `ExecuteInGameThread` first, otherwise the game hard-crashes.
- UE4SS `LoadAsset` fails for LogicMods assets (no AssetRegistry patch); the
  widget class is loaded via `AssetRegistryHelpers:GetAsset()` like
  BPModLoader does.
- `USlider` drags never write back the `Value` UPROPERTY — live values must
  come from `GetValue()`. The reverse also bites: `SetValue()` on a live
  widget doesn't reliably move the Slate handle, so programmatic writes
  (reset, preset load) verify with a readback and rebuild the widget on
  mismatch — construction initializes Slate from values set before
  `AddToViewport`, which always works.
- The game keeps stealing input mode while the panel is open, so
  `SetInputMode_UIOnlyEx` is re-asserted every poll tick (80 ms, only while
  the panel is visible; zero background cost when hidden).
- SB hides the **hardware cursor** no matter how often `bShowMouseCursor` is
  reasserted — mouse input works over the panel, but the pointer is
  invisible. DekCNS solved this with a self-ticking virtual-cursor widget
  (`WB_MouseCursor`: a `HitTestInvisible` image following
  `GetMousePositionScaledByDPI` every frame), so if CNS is installed the
  tuner spawns one of those above the panel and removes it on hide. Without
  CNS the panel still works with the invisible pointer.
- On Lua hot-reload, stale widget instances are purged from the viewport
  before creating a new one.

Tested on the Steam release (UE4SS 3.0.1, also under Proton). Feel free to
use, adapt, or rewrite any of this for the mod — no credit needed.
